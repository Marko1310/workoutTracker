# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

- **NestJS (Backend):**
  NestJS is used for building the backend of the application. It is a powerful, extensible framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications using TypeScript.

- **PostgreSQL (Database):**
  PostgreSQL is the chosen relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and manage workout program, workout, exercise, and user data.

- **React (Frontend):**
  The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React enables the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces for an enhanced user experience.

- **Authentication with JWT**
  The app implements JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication. User authentication is handled securely, allowing users to log in and access their personalized workout data.

- **Authorization with Casl**
  Casl is used for fine-grained access control and authorization. It helps manage permissions based on roles and ensures that users have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions.

- **Validation with Zod**
  Zod is employed for data validation. It ensures that input data adheres to the specified schema, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the application.

- **React Query**
  React Query is utilized to manage state and handle data fetching seamlessly. It provides a powerful set of tools for managing and caching API data in a React application.

- **React Reducer**
  React Reducer is employed to manage state on the client-side. It enables efficient state management and facilitates the handling of complex application states.

- **Tailwind**
  Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend components. It provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easy to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Material-UI (MUI)**
  Material-UI is integrated to enhance the UI with pre-built React components following the Material Design principles. It provides a consistent and visually pleasing user experience.
